- I built form with HTML and CSS that can submit the Name and Email with validation. And I use Python flask for taking input from user and show the user's name and email is received or not

- Tools : Python Flask,HTML,CSS 

- To run the app
-     -Go to app folder
-     - right click and open the terminal
-     - check the python exist or not : type "python"
-     -  If exist then type command "pip install flask"
-     - After the installing the flask Type the "python app.py"
-     - Copy the "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"
-     - Paste in the browser
